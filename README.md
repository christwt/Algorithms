#Algorithms

Learn a set of ‘‘standard’’ or canonical algorithms for computational problem solving. This involves
Understanding properties of algorithms.
Proving these properties mathematically.
Proving rigorous time and space complexity bounds on the performance.
Understand the relative merits or demerits of an algorithm, in practice.
Apply: Adapt and combine algorithms creatively to solve problems that may arise in practice.
Use algorithms to solve core problems that may arise inside applications.
Learn key tricks (motifs) underlying the design of new algorithms for emerging applications.
